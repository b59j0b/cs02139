ARE   132: Cooperative Business Enterprises 
Final Project: Case Study of Cooperative Business Enterprises 
Learning objectives:
This project   allows you to   apply the material   covered throughout   the   quarter   in   an   analysis   of an   existing   cooperative   business   or   organization   of   your   choice.An   important aspect of   successfully completing this   project is to identify a   business issue or   market failure   and   clearly   focus   on   offering   possible   solutions.   The   more   specific   you   are,   the   easier   it   will   be   to   complete   your   project   successfully.   Throughout   your   analysis,   you   are   expected   to   develop   an   in-depth   understanding   of   the   business   or   organization   and   think   about   potential   strategies to address your identified issue. I strongly encourage you to reach out to the business or   organization you are analyzing and talk to management, members and/or patrons.
Content and Structure: 
Your final project should be no longer than   10 pages (double-spaced), and   should provide   an   answer   to   each   of   the   following   seven   questions:
1)      What is an issue the business or institution is   currently   facing?
2) Description of the cooperative (collective or organization). 
a) Industry of operation 
b) Products and/or services provided 
c)       Organizational structure (e.g., who is horizontally coordinating and are they vertically integrating?) 
3) What economic conditions (production, market, regulatory) are affecting the cooperative (either its formation or its current operations)? 
4) What economic rationale supports the cooperative’s existence (more than one rationale may be relevant)? 
5)      How are contemporary cooperative principles demonstrated? (At the   minimum, address the three principles defined by the USDA, but you might also refer to the seven principles   defined by ICA depending on the business.)? 
6)      Has the firm’s cooperative structure (either organizational principles   or   government regulations) had an adverse impact on the cooperative’s business performance? What   are   specific management challenges faced and market strategies pursued? 
7)      What specific recommendations and suggestions can you give based   on your   analysis?
Sample Outlines:

We will provide additional guidance and feedback throughout the quarter.   Please   also   ask   questions in lecture and reach out during   student hours.
Groups: 
You will be working on this project in groups of   5-7 students.   Groups will be   assigned   during the   second   week   of   instructions.While I encourage you to assign tasks to each other   once you   are   assigned to   groups,   each   member should be familiar with and contribute to all aspects   of   this project.   That   includes   reading and editing drafts before   submissions.
Deliverables: 
You are asked to submit a one-page case   study proposal   (topic   and brief   outline) by   the   end   of   the third week (Sunday, January 26th) to receive initial feedback.
Your complete case study is due at the beginning   of   our last   lecture   (Thursday, March 13).
While you have to upload a pdf   version to Canvas, you can also bring a printed version to   class that day. A grading rubric and further instructions are posted   on   Canvas.
Please note that all group members will receive the same grade for t代 写ARE 132: Cooperative Business EnterprisesJava

If a member has not participated       until week 8 of the quarter (Tuesday, February 25) he/she/they can be removed from the group and will have to complete their own project. A   5-point penalty   will   be   applied   to   individually submitted projects unless an exception or special permission was   granted. 
Please note that the final project assignment created on Canvas   includes   a rubric   for   additional   guidance regarding grading guidelines.
We do not prohibit use of   GenAI (e.g., ChatGPT and Gemini), but   encourage you   to be thoughtful and transparent. When carefully checked for accuracy, these tools   can   enhance your research and scientific writing, but overreliance on AI has been shown to hinder   critical reflection and erode expertise. These tools are trained to   find patterns   and generate text   by predicting the likeliest response based on their training data. They do not understand   context   or create original ideas, and they make a lot of   mistakes.   While they   can   help   you brainstorm   topics   and provide basic editorial feedback, they are not a substitute   to   reviewing   the   literature   yourself,   critically reflecting on and continuously editing your writing. For guidance on   how   to   cite   your AI   use, please   see   this link. If   you   are   looking   to   improve   your   writing, I   also   encourage   you   to take   advantage   of   the   services   offered   by   the AATC Writing Support Center.
References: You are free to use academic resources, reports, and websites. Please do not   just   copy   and paste   information and be sure to reference all your sources.    You are   required   to   cite   a   reference   even   if   you rephrase what you have read. That is also true for graphs   or tables that you   are   including,   unless   you   are   creating   those   yourself.
Proper citation: If   you are citing an article   or other   sources   in   the   text,   you   do   not   have   to   write out the title and full author name. Instead, you include the last   name   and publication year   only.   If   you cite word for word, you will also have to reference the page number as well.
You   then   include   the   complete   information   for   all   of   your   references   used   in   the   reference section at the end   of   your paper.
Citation styles vary slightly across academic   outlets   and   other publications   in Economics.   I   do not require that you follow a particular style. as   long   as you   are   consistent throughout   and   include   all information to identify and access your source. Please refer to   sample   references   and   styles published by AEA (https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references) for additional   guidance.
